        "This cell handles the initial setup by installing all the necessary libraries needed for training the models. I created a helper function called `pip_install()` that wraps the subprocess command to install packages quietly, keeping the output clean. The main packages being installed include transformers for working with BERT models, datasets for managing the training data, accelerate to speed up the training process, evaluate for computing metrics, and openpyxl for exporting results to Excel later.\n",
        "\n",
        "After installation, the cell checks the environment to confirm everything is ready. It imports torch and checks whether a GPU is available, which is crucial since training these models on CPU would take far too long. The environment check prints out details like the Python version, PyTorch version, GPU name (hopefully a T4 in Colab), CUDA version, and available GPU memory. If no GPU is detected, it shows a warning reminding me to enable it in the runtime settings. This verification step gives confidence that the training will run smoothly before investing time in the actual training process."

Starting with torch, which is the foundation for deep learning operations, followed by numpy and pandas for data manipulation. The transformers library imports are particularly important since they provide access to the pre-trained BERT models (AutoTokenizer and AutoModelForQuestionAnswering), along with the Trainer class that handles the training loop. The datasets library is imported to convert pandas DataFrames into a format that works seamlessly with the Trainer.\n",

The GPU configuration section checks if CUDA is available and sets up the device accordingly. Seeing that GPU check pass is always reassuring since it confirms the notebook will train at a reasonable speed. The cell then handles file upload using Colab's files.upload() function, which opens a dialog to select the cardiovascular dataset CSV. If the upload fails for any reason, it falls back to a default filename, which is a helpful safeguard during development."

The cleaned dataset is then shuffled randomly with `sample(frac=1.0, random_state=42)` to ensure the model doesn't learn any patterns based on the original ordering. Finally, the data is split into training and validation sets using an 85/15 ratio. The training set will be used to teach the models, while the validation set helps evaluate how well they generalize to unseen questions. Printing the split sizes confirms everything is ready for the next step."

        "\n",
        "This cell defines two critical functions that will be used throughout the training process. The first function, `prepare_train_features()`, handles tokenization, which is the process of converting text into numerical tokens that BERT models can understand. What makes this function interesting is that it adapts to both cased and uncased models by detecting the tokenizer type. It checks if the model preserves capitalization using `getattr(tokenizer, 'do_lower_case', False)`, which is important because BioBERT is cased while BlueBERT is uncased.\n",
        "\n",
        "The tokenization process pairs each question with its corresponding answer, truncating longer texts to fit within the MAX_LENGTH of 384 tokens while using a DOC_STRIDE of 128 for overlapping windows. The function then searches for the actual answer position within the tokenized text instead of using fixed positions. For cased models like BioBERT, it performs case-insensitive matching to find where the answer begins, which helps improve accuracy. The answer span length is calculated dynamically based on the answer text length, ranging from 30 to 80 tokens. This adaptive approach should help both models locate answers more accurately.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second function, `compute_qa_metrics()`, calculates several evaluation metrics after each training epoch. It compares the model's predicted start and end positions with the true positions to compute exact match rates, start accuracy, and end accuracy. More importantly, it calculates F1 score, precision, and recall by treating the answer span as a set of token positions and measuring the overlap between predicted and true tokens. The composite accuracy combines exact match with start and end accuracy, providing a single number that reflects overall performance. These metrics help me understand not just whether the model is getting the exact answer right, but also how close it is when it's wrong."

The model being used is \"aaditya/Bluebert_emrqa\", which is an uncased BERT model that has been pre-trained on clinical text and fine-tuned for question answering tasks. I chose to test 10 different configurations because finding the optimal hyperparameters requires experimentation. Each configuration varies the number of epochs, learning rate, batch size, gradient accumulation steps, warmup ratio, and weight decay to explore how these parameters affect performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "The training process starts by loading the tokenizer once and applying it to both the training and validation datasets using the `prepare_train_features()` function defined earlier. This tokenization step happens before the training loop to avoid repeating it unnecessarily. Then, for each of the 10 iterations, a fresh model is loaded from the pre-trained checkpoint to ensure each configuration starts from the same baseline. This is important for fair comparison.\n",

Notable settings include fp16=True for mixed precision training, which speeds things up and reduces memory usage on the T4 GPU, and eval_strategy=\"epoch\" so the model is evaluated after each epoch. The Trainer class handles the actual training loop, computing gradients, updating weights, and calling the metrics function. After training completes, the cell evaluates the model on the validation set and records all the metrics along with the runtime.\n",

        "At the end of each iteration, the model and trainer are explicitly deleted and the GPU cache is cleared using `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`. This prevents memory from accumulating across iterations, which could cause out-of-memory errors. Finally, after all 10 iterations complete, the results are displayed in a summary table showing which configuration performed best. This systematic approach makes it easier to identify the optimal hyperparameters for BlueBERT on this cardiovascular dataset."

        "This cell mirrors the BlueBERT training process but uses the BioBERT model instead. The model identifier is \"dmis-lab/biobert-base-cased-v1.1\", which is a cased BERT variant that was pre-trained on biomedical literature from PubMed. The key difference between this and BlueBERT is that BioBERT preserves capitalization in the text, which can be important for medical terminology where case sometimes carries meaning. To ensure a fair comparison, this cell uses exactly the same hyperparameter configurations as the BlueBERT training.\n",
        "\n",
        "The structure follows the same pattern as before. The BioBERT tokenizer is loaded and applied to the training and validation datasets. Since the tokenization function I wrote earlier detects whether a model is cased or uncased, it automatically adjusts the answer-finding logic for BioBERT's cased tokenizer. This should help BioBERT achieve better exact match scores compared to using fixed answer positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of the 10 iterations loads a fresh BioBERT model, trains it with the specified hyperparameters, evaluates it on the validation set, and records the performance metrics. The training arguments are identical to those used for BlueBERT, including mixed precision training, gradient accumulation, and warmup steps. After each iteration, memory is carefully cleaned up to prevent GPU memory issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once all 10 iterations complete, the results are displayed in a summary table. By comparing the BioBERT results with the BlueBERT results from the previous cell, I can determine which model architecture performs better for cardiovascular question answering and which hyperparameter configuration works best for each model. This side-by-side comparison is the core of the experiment."

After running 10 iterations for each model, I need to identify the single best configuration for BlueBERT and the single best configuration for BioBERT. The comparison is based on F1 score, which is the most reliable metric for question answering tasks since it measures how well the model captures the right answer tokens, even if it doesn't match exactly.\n",

It then prints out detailed information about both winners, including not just the F1 score but also accuracy, precision, recall, and the specific hyperparameters that produced those results. This information is valuable because it tells me which combination of epochs, learning rate, batch size, and other settings worked best for each model architecture.\n",

While both models might perform well, this helps establish which one is ultimately better suited for answering cardiovascular health questions. The results from this analysis will guide the next steps, where the best models are retrained and saved for future use."
