        "\n",
        "This dataset focuses exclusively on cardiovascular-related health issues, offering a specialized resource for exploring how language models can enhance medical understanding and patient care in this domain. Built on MedQuAD the Medical Question Answering Dataset it provides a rich collection of text data suitable for tasks such as summarization, question answering, token labeling, and text classification. With support for large language models, healthcare-specific transformers, and LayoutLM models for semi-structured documents, the dataset is particularly well-suited for developing NLP applications that simplify complex cardiovascular information, improve accessibility for patients, and assist healthcare professionals in decision-making.\n",
        "\n",
        "The file itself is a CSV version of MedQuAD converted from XML source files, excluding MedLinePlus data due to licensing restrictions. MedQuAD contains 47,457 medical question-answer pairs from 12 NIH websites, covering 37 question types such as treatment, diagnosis, and side effects, with additional annotations like question type, focus, synonyms, UMLS identifiers, and semantic categories. While some subsets had answers removed to respect copyright, metadata and URLs remain available for further exploration. The dataset also includes a QA test collection with 2,479 judged answers from the TREC-2017 LiveQA medical task, enabling evaluation of IR and QA systems. Together, these resources provide a comprehensive foundation for cardiovascular-focused NLP research and experimentation.\n"

        "\n",
        "This section prepares the Google Colab environment for running machine learning code.\n",

        "  * Datasets (version 2.14.0+) - for efficient data handling\n",
        "  * Accelerate (version 0.26.0+) - for optimized training\n",

        "* Offers two approaches to get your data into Colab:\n",
        "  * **Option A (Google Drive):** Mount your Google Drive and load CSV from there\n",
        "  * **Option B (Direct Upload):** Upload the file directly from your computer\n",
        "* Uses flags (USE_DRIVE and USE_UPLOAD) to control which method is active\n",
        "* Defaults to upload method for simplicity\n",
        "* For Drive method: you specify the file path in your Drive\n",

        "* `uploaded = files.upload()` - opens file selection dialog\n",
        "\n",
        "Some users prefer keeping datasets in Google Drive so they persist across sessions. Others prefer uploading fresh files each time. Both methods work well depending on your workflow preferences.\n",

        "* Removes rows with missing data (null values in question or answer columns)\n",
        "* Shuffles the entire dataset randomly (using seed 42 for reproducibility)\n",

        "\n",
        "Missing data would cause errors during training. Shuffling ensures the model sees diverse examples. The 80/20 split is standard - it gives plenty of training data while keeping enough test data to properly evaluate how well the model generalizes to unseen questions.\n",

This gives it deep understanding of clinical language, medical procedures, and healthcare terminology as it appears in actual patient records. The \"emrqa\" variant has been further fine-tuned for question answering on EMR data, making it particularly good at handling clinical questions.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "* Converts Pandas dataframes to Hugging Face Dataset objects\n",
        "* Sets maximum sequence length to 384 tokens\n",
        "* Sets document stride to 128 tokens (for handling long passages)\n",

        "  * Sets positions to 0 if no valid context exists\n",
        "  * Removes offset mappings before returning (not needed by model)\n",

        "* Applies tokenization to test dataset in batches\n",

        "\n",

        "* `tokenized.pop(\"offset_mapping\")` - removes temporary data\n",
        "\n",
        "Extractive question answering is harder than simple classification. The model must learn to predict exactly which tokens in the text form the answer. This requires precise position labels for both the start and end of the answer span. The tokenization process must carefully track these positions while handling edge cases like very long texts that need to be split.\n",
