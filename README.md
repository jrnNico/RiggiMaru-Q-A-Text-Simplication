## Model File

The model file (`model.safetensors`) is too large to be uploaded to GitHub (exceeds 100MB limit).

You can download the model from the following Google Drive link:

[Download model.safetensors](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mCC2cTOF4pmw6Rp7xPMwv8oxqtZENTdW?usp=sharing)

**Note:** Add the downloaded file to `Final Model/best_cardio_BlueBert_model/model.safetensors` in your local directory if needed.
