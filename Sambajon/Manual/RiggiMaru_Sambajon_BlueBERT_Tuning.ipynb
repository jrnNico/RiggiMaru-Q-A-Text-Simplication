        "## Code Structure and Functionality\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Environment Setup and Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "This code block prepares the Google Colab environment for fine-tuning the BlueBERT model on cardiovascular question-answering tasks. It defines a utility function `pip_install()` to quietly install essential Python packages including Transformers (≥4.44.0) for working with pre-trained models, Datasets (≥2.14.0) for efficient data handling, Accelerate (≥0.26.0) for optimized training, and Evaluate (≥0.4.0) for performance metrics. After installing these dependencies, the code performs comprehensive environment diagnostics by displaying Python version, platform information, PyTorch version, and critically checks for GPU availability. If a CUDA-enabled GPU is detected, it displays the GPU name (ideally T4 for Colab) and CUDA version. If no GPU is found, it prompts the user to enable GPU acceleration in Colab's runtime settings, which is essential for efficient transformer model training.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Imports and GPU Configuration\n",
        "\n",
        "This section imports all necessary libraries for the machine learning pipeline including PyTorch for deep learning, NumPy for numerical operations, Pandas for data manipulation, and critical Transformers components like `AutoTokenizer` and `AutoModelForQuestionAnswering` for handling pre-trained models. It also imports `TrainingArguments`, `Trainer`, and `default_data_collator` to streamline the fine-tuning process, along with the `Dataset` class for efficient data handling. Warning messages are suppressed for cleaner output. The GPU configuration logic then checks if CUDA is available and creates the appropriate device object (GPU or CPU fallback). For GPU setups, it displays detailed information including the GPU model name, CUDA version, and total GPU memory in gigabytes—crucial information for optimizing batch sizes and memory usage during training on T4's 16GB VRAM.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Dataset Loading Options\n",
        "\n",
        "This block provides flexible methods for loading the cardiovascular QA dataset in Google Colab. Users can toggle between two approaches via boolean flags: **Option A** mounts Google Drive to access a CSV file stored there (requiring the user to specify the Drive path), while **Option B** uses Colab's file upload interface to let users upload a file directly from their local machine. The code defaults to the upload option for simplicity. After attempting the selected method, it validates that a valid CSV path was obtained; if not, it raises a `ValueError` to alert the user that the dataset must be provided before proceeding. This dual-option design accommodates different user workflows and data storage preferences in the Colab environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Data Loading and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the CSV path is established, this section loads the cardiovascular medical QA dataset using Pandas and performs essential preprocessing. It first reads the CSV file and displays diagnostic information including total record count, column names, a sample question preview (first 80 characters), and the character length of a sample answer to give users insight into the dataset structure. The code then removes any rows with null values in the critical `question` or `answer` columns to ensure data quality. Next, it randomly shuffles the dataset with a fixed random seed (42) for reproducibility and splits it into training and validation sets using an 85/15 ratio—a standard split that provides substantial training data while reserving enough examples for meaningful validation during and after training. This preprocessing ensures clean, well-organized data ready for tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 5. Model and Tokenizer Initialization\n",
        "\n",
        "This block initializes the pre-trained BlueBERT model specifically fine-tuned for medical question answering. It loads the `\"aaditya/Bluebert_emrqa\"` model from the Hugging Face Hub, which is a BERT variant pre-trained on biomedical literature and further adapted for extractive question answering in electronic medical records (EMR). This specialized pre-training gives BlueBERT a strong foundation in medical terminology and QA patterns specific to clinical text. Both the tokenizer and model are loaded using Auto classes, which automatically handle the correct architecture and configuration. The tokenizer is initialized with fast tokenizer mode enabled for improved performance. Once loaded, the model is transferred to the appropriate device (GPU if available, otherwise CPU) to leverage hardware acceleration for all subsequent operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. Tokenization and Feature Preparation\n",
        "\n",
        "This critical section transforms raw text data into numerical representations that the BlueBERT model can process, while also preparing labels for extractive question answering. The code converts Pandas DataFrames into Hugging Face Dataset objects and defines key parameters: maximum sequence length (384 tokens) and document stride (128 tokens) for handling long contexts. The `prepare_train_features()` function tokenizes both questions and answers together, truncating only the answer portion if necessary to fit within the maximum length. For extractive QA, the model must predict start and end positions of the answer span within the tokenized context. The function identifies which tokens belong to the context (sequence_id == 1) versus the question, then sets start and end position labels accordingly—if no valid context exists, both positions default to 0. The function handles overflowing tokens by creating multiple training examples from long contexts and removes the offset_mapping data structure before returning, as it's only needed during preprocessing. This tokenization is applied to both training and validation datasets in batched mode for efficiency.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 7. Evaluation Metrics Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "This section defines custom evaluation metrics specifically designed for question answering tasks. The `compute_qa_metrics()` function receives predictions and labels from the model, extracting start and end logits for each example and converting them to predicted token positions using argmax. It calculates four key metrics: **exact match** (percentage where both start and end positions are perfectly predicted), **start accuracy** (correctness of start position), **end accuracy** (correctness of end position), and **token-level F1 score**. The F1 calculation is sophisticated—it treats predicted and actual answer spans as sets of token positions and computes precision and recall based on their overlap. Special cases are handled appropriately: if both spans are empty, F1 is 1.0; if only one is empty, F1 is 0.0. For overlapping spans, it calculates the intersection of token positions to derive precision (overlap/predicted tokens) and recall (overlap/true tokens), then combines them into the harmonic mean F1 score. These metrics provide comprehensive insight into the model's ability to accurately locate answer spans.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 8. Training Configuration (T4 GPU Optimized)\n",
        "\n",
        "This block configures all hyperparameters and training settings specifically optimized for Google Colab's T4 GPU (16GB VRAM). The `TrainingArguments` object is carefully tuned to maximize performance while avoiding out-of-memory errors. Key optimizations include: **batch size of 8** (optimal for T4's memory when working with BERT models), **gradient accumulation of 4 steps** (creating an effective batch size of 32 for stable gradients), **5 epochs** for better convergence, **learning rate of 2e-5** (slightly lower than standard for medical domain stability), **warmup ratio of 15%** for gradual adaptation, and **FP16 mixed-precision training** enabled (essential for T4—roughly doubles speed and halves memory usage). The configuration uses PyTorch's native AdamW optimizer (`adamw_torch`) which is faster on T4, evaluates and checkpoints at each epoch end, keeps only the best 2 checkpoints based on F1 score, and logs every 25 steps for better training visibility. These T4-specific settings balance training speed, memory efficiency, and model performance for the cardiovascular QA task.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 9. Trainer Initialization\n",
        "\n",
        "This section instantiates the Hugging Face `Trainer` object, which orchestrates the entire training and evaluation pipeline. The Trainer combines the BlueBERT model, training arguments, tokenized datasets, tokenizer, data collator, and custom metrics function into a unified training system. The `default_data_collator` handles batching and padding of tokenized examples to ensure uniform tensor sizes within each batch. By providing both training and evaluation datasets, the Trainer automatically runs validation at intervals specified in the training arguments. The `compute_metrics` function enables automatic calculation of custom QA metrics during evaluation, providing real-time feedback on model performance. This high-level abstraction handles complex training loop aspects including gradient computation, backpropagation, optimizer steps, learning rate scheduling, mixed-precision training, logging, checkpointing, and distributed training if multiple GPUs are available—simplifying what would otherwise require hundreds of lines of custom code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 10. Hyperparameter Tuning Experiment (T4 GPU Optimized - 10 Iterations)\n",
        "\n",
        "This extensive block implements a focused hyperparameter search across 10 carefully selected configurations optimized for T4 GPU constraints. Unlike generic searches, this experiment is specifically tuned to work within T4's 16GB memory limit while maximizing efficiency. All configurations use a **fixed batch size of 8** (the sweet spot for BERT on T4—large enough for stable gradients, small enough to avoid OOM errors) with **gradient accumulation of 4** (creating an effective batch size of 32, ideal for transformer fine-tuning). The experiment systematically explores: **epochs** (5-10 for faster iteration), **learning rates** (1e-5 to 5e-5, centered around 2e-5 for medical domain stability), **warmup ratios** (0.1-0.2 for testing different warmup strategies), and **weight decay** (0.01 for regularization). For each configuration, the code **critically reloads a fresh BlueBERT model** to ensure each experiment starts from identical initialization, preventing weight contamination between runs. The training loop executes the full process, measures runtime, evaluates on validation set, and computes detailed precision and recall through token-level overlap analysis between predicted and true answer spans. All results are collected in an Excel workbook with formatted headers and auto-adjusted column widths, enabling easy comparison. This focused 10-iteration search completes faster than broader searches while targeting the most impactful hyperparameter combinations for cardiovascular QA on T4 hardware with BlueBERT.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 11. Final Training and Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "This section executes the actual training using the optimized configuration from section 8 and performs comprehensive evaluation. The code calls `trainer.train()` to begin the fine-tuning process, which runs for 5 epochs with the T4-optimized settings (batch size 8, gradient accumulation 4, learning rate 2e-5, FP16 enabled). During training, the Trainer automatically handles the forward pass, loss calculation, backward pass, gradient accumulation, optimizer steps, learning rate scheduling, and periodic evaluation at each epoch end. After training completes, the code displays the final training loss to show convergence. The evaluation section then runs `trainer.evaluate()` on the validation set to compute all custom metrics including exact match, start accuracy, end accuracy, and F1 score. These final metrics provide a comprehensive assessment of how well the fine-tuned BlueBERT model performs on the cardiovascular question-answering task, measuring its ability to accurately identify answer spans within medical text passages. The sorted output makes it easy to review all performance metrics at a glance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 12. Model Saving and Persistence\n",
        "\n",
        "This final section handles the crucial task of saving the trained model for future use and deployment. The code uses the Trainer's `save_model()` method to serialize the fine-tuned model weights, configuration, and tokenizer to a local directory (`./fine_tuned_cardio_qa_model`) on the Colab runtime. All essential components are saved including the PyTorch model weights (pytorch_model.bin), model configuration (config.json), and tokenizer files (tokenizer_config.json, vocab.txt, special_tokens_map.json). This creates a complete, self-contained model package that can be loaded later for inference or further fine-tuning using standard Hugging Face methods. Additionally, the section provides an optional mechanism to copy the saved model to Google Drive for long-term persistence. Since Colab runtime storage is temporary and gets erased when the session ends, the Drive backup option (controlled by the `SAVE_TO_DRIVE` flag) ensures the model remains accessible beyond the current session. When enabled, the code mounts Google Drive (if not already mounted), removes any existing model directory at the destination path, and copies the entire model directory to `/content/drive/MyDrive/fine_tuned_cardio_qa_model`. This dual-saving approach provides both immediate local access during the current session and long-term cloud storage persistence, making the trained model ready for production deployment or sharing."
